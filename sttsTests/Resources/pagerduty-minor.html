Teams began noticing general slow downs within other internal systems and began a separate investigation before a connection between the delayed requests and other issues was noticed. At that time, the response efforts were joined and mitigations were put in place to prevent further degradation until the afflicted service could recover. We discovered that the low-throughput subscription management system had inadvertently been coupled to higher-throughput systems within PagerDuty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 13:42 UTC, we prevented new calls to the subscription management service, allowing our systems to begin returning to normal operation.

This caching step ensures that events can be promptly read back, guaranteeing consistency. However, during the incident window between 18:00 UTC and 19:22 UTC, this caching mechanism was affected by the zone-specific degradation, resulting in cascading delays in the handling of events. In some cases, events had to be momentarily set aside which resulted in longer delays, but those events were eventually successfully processed on a subsequent attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 18:03 UTC, on-call responders were notified of the issue by monitoring, and they began working to ensure that the small number of events facing long delays were reprocessed successfully.

Multiple resolution strategies were attempted or considered by the response team, and by 19:22 UTC the impact to customers' events had subsided.

Some Workflows that were configured to add responders or stakeholders failed to complete, and did not add the intended responders or stakeholders to the linked incident. Specifically, Incident Workflows with actions that added responders or added stakeholders, and where the actions were created prior to June 12th, 2023, were impacted. All customers who were directly affected by this incident were contacted on July 19th through an email to the account owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 12th, we released a new version of the add responders and add stakeholders actions. When we release new action versions, typically customers do not need to update their existing workflows, or opt-in to use the latest version when they are adding new actions to a workflow. The old version remains available, and workflows configured with older versions continue to work unchanged. This new version changed the input type from multipleChoice to json, which was done to better reflect the JSON structure of the input. With this change, none of the latest versions of production actions were using the multipleChoice input type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 28th, we released a change to our staging environment that expanded the supported types for action inputs in the action execution runtime. We tested this change in staging against the latest versions of our actions in production, but critically we did not test against older supported action versions. This change contained a regression in processing multipleChoice inputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 21:45 UTC on July 14th, that change was deployed to production along with several other changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 01:45 UTC on July 15th, we received the first report of a problem with Incident Workflows from Customer Success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 03:30 UTC on July 15th, after receiving additional reports, we opened an incident to investigate. Based on the initial reports we received and our internal investigations, we misdiagnosed the problem as stemming from recently edited workflows with old action versions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 04:33 UTC, we tested a potential mitigation for users who were editing their workflows and encountering this problem. Editing the workflow to first remove then re-add the add responders and stakeholders actions upgraded them to the latest version, which was not impacted by the bug. We confirmed that workflows ran correctly after they were edited in this way. At this time, we were still operating on the belief that the bug was in the editing or updating function, not in the action execution itself. We advised impacted customers who were editing their workflows to use the mitigation until we had sufficient time to develop and test a fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 22:38 UTC on July 16th, we received reports of additional occurrences and began investigating further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 23:57 UTC on July 16th, investigation confirmed that all invocations of the older versions of the add responders and add stakeholders actions were failing. We identified the change on June 28th as the cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 00:08 UTC on July 17th, we deployed a revert of the offending change. By 00:11 UTC, our logs showed no further failing actions. We continued to monitor the logs until 00:40 UTC when we resolved the incident after seeing no more occurrences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat We’re Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the incident, our teams conducted a comprehensive postmortem investigation.

These events had the potential to create duplicate alerts, incidents and notifications in the US Service Region that would have been sent between 14:02 UTC and 14:26 UTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn June 21st, 2023 at 12:33 UTC, our teams noticed event lag for service events in the US Service Region.

We did not have the proper safeguards to prevent it from overloading the event ingestion pipeline, causing delayed notifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhile trying to remediate the issue, we accidentally set an improper recovery variable, causing messages up to 8 days prior to be reprocessed for some accounts.

This incident resulted in intermittent errors when adding event-based integrations to services. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, customers in the EU service regions trying to add new integrations to services in PagerDuty would receive errors and would have to retry saving these changes several times for them to take effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvent ingestion and incident notifications were unaffected during this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur team was migrating the database, which is used to store routing keys to integration transformation mappings, from a manually managed to a fully managed infrastructure. During this migration, replication was set up from the existing database to the new database. This replication was set up via a replica of the existing database’s primary node to the new database’s primary node. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an initial step to switch over the service relying on this database, read-only traffic was pointed to the new database’s read-only replica. The additional jumps in the replication chain resulted in increased replication lag. This replication lag led to certain requests failing if they were requests to services utilizing this database, because data that had just been written to the database was not available to queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis resulted in requests to create new integrations failing, until replication caught up and the read-only queries succeeded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese failing requests were initially missed because they were happening intermittently and our monitoring did not catch them. On June 2nd, another team noticed these errors and started our incident response process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped the migration and pointed read-only traffic back to the old database’s replicas, which returned replication lag to previous levels. This caused all requests to succeed again immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat We Are Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this incident, our teams conducted a thorough post mortem investigation. We will adjust our monitoring thresholds, adapt the migration process to reduce the replication lag, and improve the service’s ability to handle increases in replication lag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sincerely apologize to the customers who may have had to make repeated requests when adding event-based integrations to services over the duration of the incident.

Unfortunately, during one such reboot sequence, an instance was rebooted out of order, causing the entire cluster to go out of service. This caused internal requests, which managed event processing, to time out until the cluster came back online. By 15:34 UTC, the system came back online and requests were being processed successfully. As a side effect of this, however, a single client in our application held onto a lock, when it should have been discarded starting at 15:45 UTC. This led to event processing being delayed for approximately 30 minutes until a rolling restart of the application freed the lock. By 16:14 UTC, recovery was seen and the remaining events were processed within 2 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe plan to approach this problem from a few angles.

Additional observability will be put in place, so we are alerted in the event a lock is stuck for faster remediation.

On Tuesday, April 18th, between 20:00 UTC and 22:07 UTC, this incident also impacted the US Service Region. During this time, responder requests were being delivered to recipients, but the recipients could not accept or decline the responder requests via SMS or voice. Tuesday April 18th at 21:55 UTC, we took steps to mitigate the issue in the EU service region and at 22:07 UTC, we took the same steps in the US service region and were able to confirm recovery in both service regions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat Happened\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTo ensure PagerDuty continues to operate on well-supported software dependencies, we completed a major version upgrade of our configuration management software on April 11 at 19:00 UTC. This upgrade introduced a faulty configuration change in the load balancer service, but without a service reload, no disruption occurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs part of another maintenance in the EU region, on April 14 at 19:52 UTC, we reloaded the load balancer service on all the nodes, thus causing a service failure due to the faulty configuration previously deployed. During this time, responder requests were being delivered to recipients, but the recipients could not accept or decline the responder requests via SMS or voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAt 22:25 UTC, our engineers triaged the problem and tested a responder request in the EU and received the notification but were unaware that acceptances or declines were not working via voice and SMS. We failed to test the complete end-to-end responder request call. No other impact was discovered at this time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn April 18th, At 20:15 UTC, a similar maintenance occurred in US regions, and the impact was immediately evident with high US traffic and elevated error rate compared to the EU region. The responsible teams started a major incident call to triage. At 21:55 UTC in the EU service region, we discovered the flawed load balancer configuration and deployed the required fix. Teams thoroughly tested the change, including the acceptances and declines for the responder request call via voice and SMS. At 22:07 UTC, an identical fix was implemented for the US service region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe ran a detailed post-mortem analysis of this occurrence which helped us pinpoint the key factors that led to this failure.

During this time, customers using the PagerDuty Web Application had a sluggish experience and saw intermittent error pages. All other components, including the Events API, Notification Delivery, REST API, and Mobile Application, functioned normally and were not impacted. This incident did not impact other service regions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe have recently been improving the customer experience in our Web Application’s Incidents UI by utilizing a technology called Websockets. Websockets maintain a connection between the browser and the backend server, which allows PagerDuty to push new updates to the browser as they happen. These improvements have been rolling out gradually to increasing numbers of customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn Thursday, April 13th, at 14:47 UTC, a code change was deployed to the servers that maintain the websocket connections. The deployment process rolls out the new code gradually over about 10 minutes, gracefully terminating an old server and starting a new one, waiting a short time, and repeating until all the servers run the new code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nDuring the deployment process, when a server is terminated, its websockets are also disconnected. This prompts all the frontends to try to reconnect and upon reconnecting, to make several data requests. The frontends attempted their reconnect with a randomized retry window, which worked well during the initial rollout of the feature. However, this was not sufficient at full rollout to effectively spread the additional request load across our available capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe were underprovisioned for the new load pattern introduced by the websockets feature. As the websockets reconnected and made their associated requests, response times increased while requests were retried, and customers saw increasingly longer times for parts of the page to be populated with data. As the request pool became overloaded, we started dropping some requests, which caused customers to see an error page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe engineer rolling out the new code change executed an Emergency Rollback out of an abundance of caution. This had the unfortunate consequence of immediately repeating the deployment process, further contributing to the websocket reconnection load issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBy 15:10 UTC, customer experience returned to normal as all websockets had reconnected, and we returned to your provisioned steady state load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFollowing this incident, our teams held a thorough incident investigation and review to determine the cause of the failure to ensure we could protect against it in the future. We have increased our server capacity to handle increased load due to the websockets feature. We have also updated the websockets code to reconnect more gracefully during deployments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe sincerely apologize for the degraded Web Application experience in our US region.

During this time, affected customers were unable to access or use these features via the web and mobile applications or the REST API.  Event processing and notification delivery functioned normally and were not impacted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs part of the launch of PagerDuty AIOps, we rolled out a change to our pricing and packaging, where features that had been previously available to Free, Professional, and Business plans would now be exclusively bundled into the new AIOps package. Although access to these features (alert suppression, dynamic field enrichment extraction, change events, and the Visibility Console) would be removed from the plans, customers who were active users of the impacted features would retain legacy access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn Tuesday, April 11th at 15:20 UTC, the package changes were pushed to production. By 15:51 UTC, we received the first customer reports of missing features. At 16:13 UTC, the team responsible for rolling out the package changes began their investigation, in particular to a report that a customer had lost access to alert suppression. This account was not in our legacy access list, and the initial investigation indicated that only a very small subset of customer accounts using alert suppression were impacted. At 17:32 UTC, we ran a script to restore access to the impacted accounts, to resolve the issue. We continued to receive reports of issues, including with our DataDog widget and users potentially being logged out of the mobile app. Respective teams investigated these issues separately, not yet knowing that they were related to the loss of legacy access. At 18:12 UTC, we received a customer report of losing feature access, this time from a customer on our legacy access list.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAt 18:39 UTC, we spun up a major incident call to coordinate our investigation, and responders noticed this issue was more widespread than initially determined. We quickly found that the legacy access script had an issue where the logic that granted access to affected features was missing a key step to fully propagate the change across all of our systems. After implementing a fix, we re-ran the script, and by 19:05 UTC, impacted customers regained access to all features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAfter this incident, our teams held a thorough incident review to ensure we would have additional controls in place for this type of packaging change. In particular, we will be reviewing the parts of our release process pertaining to identifying impacted and legacy-eligible accounts and for rolling out packaging changes, including enhanced monitoring around rollouts. We have already resolved the root cause of the legacy-enablement script as well as the inadvertent logout of users from the mobile app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOur teams will conduct a thorough review of potentially impacted accounts to ensure that no further customers are missing access to features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe sincerely apologize to the customers who lost access to PagerDuty functionality for the duration of the incident.

During this time, customers interacting with the REST API experienced increased 5xx error rates and increased response times. 91% of requests to the REST API were still successful during this time period. All other components including the Events API, Notification Delivery, Web Application, and Mobile Application functioned normally and were not impacted. Other service regions were not impacted by this incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe had recently completed an upgrade that moved our REST API services onto our new container runtime infrastructure. This upgrade provides us with new capabilities for us to provide a more reliable and resilient service for you, our customers. Throughout the testing, verification, and rollout process, the service operated normally and without issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nToday, our REST API services consist of a primary service for handling requests and a sidecar proxy that handles service discovery and other networking-related concerns. When a request is processed by our REST API service, it is first handled by this primary service and then proxied through the sidecar before arriving at a final destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn Saturday, April 1st at 20:46 UTC, a subset of our REST API instances encountered a “noisy neighbor” condition, leaving them unable to obtain the necessary compute resources to continue processing requests. In these instances, the primary service exited and was restarted by the container runtime. Upon restarting, the primary service entered a state where it was able to receive traffic but it was unable to communicate with the sidecar proxy to complete the proper handling of the request. These instances were effectively in an unhealthy state but our health checks did not correctly model this failure mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBy 20:48 UTC approximately 12% of requests to the REST API in the US service region were resulting in a 5xx response code. At this same time the team responsible for the PagerDuty REST API was paged. During the initial response we saw signs that the REST API might be overloaded. We scaled up our REST API by 50% and by 21:05 UTC, only 8% of requests were resulting in a 5xx response code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAware that our REST API had recently been moved to the new container runtime, we simultaneously began the process of moving back to our legacy container runtime. Since we believed that the REST API was only in a state of partial failure, we performed this rollback in a way that minimized our risk of exacerbating the problem even further. We took care to avoid a state where the new runtime instances had been removed but the legacy runtime instances had not yet completed deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBy 21:21 UTC, the last of the unhealthy instances were removed as part of the rollback process. Error rates for the REST API in the US service region had returned to normal levels by 21:22 UTC. No other service regions or systems were affected during this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Are Doing About This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFollowing this incident, our teams held a thorough incident review to ensure we have additional controls in place for this failure mode. In particular we will be changing our health check strategy to correctly detect this unhealthy service state and we have already resolved the root cause of the noisy neighbor condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOur teams continue to investigate both the cause of how these REST API instances ended up in a state where they were unable to establish intra-pod network connections after the noisy neighbor condition and whether additional infrastructure changes are required to ensure proper resource allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe sincerely apologize for the degraded REST API service in our US region.

An additional contributing factor in not detecting the error prior to the production deployment was that our validation process was not effective and that similar secret key names were used in these systems. Around 18:25 UTC, a decision was made to toggle a switch on to return 200s empty responses instead of 500s from this API until the issue was resolved.

PagerDuty experienced another incident between 16:16 UTC and 18:57 UTC on Tuesday, February 14th that caused delays of up to 9 minutes in the delivery of notifications and subscriber updates in the US and EU service regions as well as bursts of errors in the Web UI, Mobile UI, and the REST API. During these periods, approximately ~1% of requests to the Web UI, Mobile UI, or REST API returned 500 “Internal Server Error” responses. The PagerDuty web application was unavailable to the EU service region between 17:55 UTC and 18:26 UTC. No events were lost or dropped during these times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe incident had multiple contributing causes, which can best summarized as “dependencies are hard.” The actual fault was caused by an upgrade of a shared component which introduced a latent bug that was only triggered when services downstream of that component were redeployed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nSeveral of our services use a request router component to send requests to downstream services. That service uses an internal base image that is one of our shared platform components. The base image was updated on Monday, February 13th at approximately 18:00 UTC to update an external software library in one of the components of the request router service to its latest minor version. Due to the combination of how the component uses this library and a change in the external library’s runtime; there was a breaking change associated with this update. The service pins the major and minor versions; this allows us to automatically get security patches when we redeploy our Web application. This change was pushed to the same minor version that our service was pinned to, so at 18:04 UTC when a new deploy for our Web application started, it automatically pulled the new base image. Both the team making the change and the teams responding to the incident were misled by the significance of the update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAn additional contributing factor in not detecting the error prior to the production deployment was that our validation process was not effective in detecting the error. The bug was latent and only materialized under load and other production conditions which made validation difficult. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAround 18:50 UTC a few teams were paged for a spike in errors in the EU service region. A downstream service in the EU service region had recently restarted, which triggered the request router service to reload in our Web application. However they failed to reload and instead crashed immediately. Our container orchestration system automatically terminated the request router service that had crashed and replaced them with healthy instances. Our teams began investigating the issues. As they investigated, a downstream service started deploying to both EU and US service regions around 19:20 UTC. Our teams were paged again for another spike in errors, this time in both EU and US regions, and initiated a major incident call. During this time customers may have observed some requests to the Web UI, Mobile UI, or REST API fail; less than 1% of all requests failed during this period. After observing no more customer impact during the incident call, the incident was assigned to a team to continue investigating and the major incident call was ended. Our teams did not post to our status page at this time because they believed the issue was transient and did not observe any ongoing customer impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAnother major incident call was started around 20:05 UTC after another spike of errors occurred. As teams rejoined the call, we updated our status page as we continued investigating the issue. Our teams looked at recent changes to the Web application and noticed there was a Web application deployed earlier that morning that had modified the file system configuration in the request router service. The change was reverted and after observing our systems in a stable state our teams concluded that the file system change was the culprit. There were no more downstream deployments for the remainder of the day. Between 18:50 - 20:15 UTC 4 notifications were delayed in the EU region which affected 2 accounts. In this same time window, 10 notifications were delayed in the US region which affected 7 accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn Tuesday, February 14th at approximately 16:16 UTC, a downstream service started deploying to both EU and US regions. Our teams were paged for another spike in errors in both regions. Similarly to the day before, customers may have observed some requests to the Web UI, Mobile UI, or REST API fail during this period. We initiated a major incident call to investigate the issue. Our teams initially concluded that the errors were transient and since there was no more ongoing customer impact the major incident call was ended. Between 16:00 - 17:00 UTC one notification was delayed in the EU region which affected one account. In the same time window, 59 notifications were delayed in the US region which affected 26 accounts. Our teams did not post to our status page at this time because they believed the issue was transient and did not observe any ongoing customer impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOur teams were paged again at 17:26 UTC and we initiated another major incident call. Customers may have observed some requests to the Web UI, Mobile UI, or REST API fail during this period. Additionally between 17:55 UTC and 18:26 UTC the PagerDuty web application was unavailable in the EU service region. The Mobile UI and REST API were still available during this time. Between 17:00 - 18:30 UTC four notifications were delayed in the EU region which affected two accounts. In the same time window, 29 notifications were delayed in the US region which affected 12 accounts. Our teams realized the previous day’s incident was not caused by the file system change. Around the same time, another service that uses the same request router service pattern as our Web application began to exhibit similar error patterns. With two services having similar issues, our engineers noticed there was a recent change to the base image and saw the external software component used for service discovery had been updated to a new minor version. Our engineers examined the changelog for the external software component and noticed there were \u003cem\u003ebreaking changes\u003c/em\u003e in the new minor version we had updated to. After identifying the cause, we updated our status page as our engineers rolled back the change in the base request router service image. After the rollback completed, they redeployed the Web application and the other affected service.

Impacted customers in this region saw either out-of-date or missing incident details during this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat Happened\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor approximately two hours beginning at 04:51 UTC on February 11, seven replicas in the US service region’s production database cluster experienced sporadic replication delays of up to 8 minutes. The replicas were all assigned to the pool responsible for providing incident details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n‌\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn February 10 at 16:30 UTC, we started a database migration in this cluster which we expected to take about 120 hours to complete. This is not unusual, and large migrations happen about once a month. Hours later, unrelated to the migration, we decommissioned one database server in the cluster due to a hardware issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n‌\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOur database migration tool, gh-ost, normally pauses itself when it detects lagging replicas, but due to the infrastructure change made earlier in the day, the replication lag detection process used by the migration tool began failing silently. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n‌\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe next morning, at 04:51 UTC on February 11, a subset of replicas then began exhibiting sporadic replication delays: They would lag for a few minutes, then the lag would resolve as the migration process would sometimes throttle itself. This happened for about 20 minutes until replication lag monitors began alerting. Once alerted, we began diagnosing the problem, which took a bit longer than expected because the lag was limited to a small subset of replicas. We then discovered a correlation between writes from the migration and replication lag: When the migration writes were being processed on the subset of replicas, the replication lag grew. Since PagerDuty reads your incident details off of these replicas, whenever a replica lagged, it would present you with out-of-date or missing incident details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n‌\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAfter determining that the replication lag was being caused by the migration, we safely stopped the migration. Within ten minutes, the replicas processed the backlog of writes, at which time, all incident detail information was current and viewable by customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe have already made the following changes to better handle this situation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nDetecting and updating the replica list gh-ost uses when an infrastructure change is made  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nAlerting sooner when replication begins lagging  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nEnhancing our migration notification process by adding additional graphs that more clearly display the current state of migrations  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n‌\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe sincerely apologize for the delayed incident details you or your teams experienced.

As a result of this failure, events destined for downstream micro-services could not flow successfully through the pipeline. While we continued to accept new incoming events and allow interaction with customer-facing web applications, processing stopped on downstream services, including the services responsible for sending out notifications.

This left customers unable to load the Visibility Console or faced an extremely high load time when trying to view the content/dashboard in the US region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat Happened\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe Visibility Console is powered by a service which itself depends on other PagerDuty services. One of these indirect dependencies was running on a shared node, where another separate service was consuming high amounts of both CPU and network bandwidth. Instances of other services running on this shared node also exhibited elevated response times from their own internal dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe slow responses from the Visibility Console’s indirect dependency caused the service powering the Visibility Console to return slow responses, leading to the Visibility Console’s unresponsiveness for users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAt 13:10 UTC, PagerDuty began an incident response process after receiving customer reports of the Visibility Console not loading. During the same time range in which the Visibility Console was unable to load, an update to our mobile app increased load on the Visibility Console’s indirect dependency. An earlier incident caused by a library update in another service also increased memory pressure on our shared infrastructure. These simultaneous increases in pressure on our infrastructure delayed our ability to identify and remediate the cause of the Visibility Console’s issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAt 14:38 UTC, after examining the metrics of the different services involved, responders suspected the slow responses to be the result of an infrastructure issue, and restarted the indirect dependency at 14:50 UTC, and the direct dependency at 15:04 UTC. Restarting both services resolved the incident, and users were able to load the Visibility Console beginning at 15:05 UTC. The incident was closed at 15:32 UTC after responders verified that the Visibility Console continued to load and the service metrics were within normal bounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat We Are Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFollowing this incident, we conducted a thorough post-mortem investigation, which identified the events that contributed to this failure. Our engineering teams have worked diligently to address these findings and ensure that we are protected from such incidents going forward. The corrective actions included the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nWe have removed the node with anomalous network performance from our infrastructure.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nWe are scheduling tests with increased load on our underlying hosts, in order to identify other areas where a service is not well isolated from increased infrastructure load.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nWe are improving the monitoring for both services involved in the incident, so that we can detect these issues before they result in outages of the Visibility Console.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nWe are documenting that when a service is seeing slow response times from one of its dependent services, but the dependent service’s response times to other callers are within expected bounds, this indicates an infrastructure issue, and rescheduling the services to other nodes is likely to be an effective remediation step.  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe sincerely apologize for the interruptions with Visibility Console that you or your teams have experienced and the impact that it had.

At 18:10 UTC, a deployment was done in one of the services responsible for the processing of events. Our system monitors proactively notified our engineers of a problem and they began investigating. Between 18:10 and 18:40 UTC, our Events API returned a higher rate of 429/500 HTTP code responses, and parts of the web UI and REST API that require event details also returned 500 HTTP error codes. At 18:41 UTC, a revert deployment had completed and error rates gradually returned to normal. From 18:41 to 19:44 UTC, a backlog of events which had been sent to a dead letter queue was being reprocessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe incident was caused by a change to traffic mirroring in the event-processing service, which uncovered a bug in another service responsible for storing the events. Invalid requests to store events from the traffic mirroring resulted in HTTP 500 responses due to a missing validation check. Consequently, the smart health checks in place caused the storage service to restart its allocations which impacted Web UI/API and Events API calls. This, in turn, caused slowdowns in the processing of notifications and incidents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTo resolve immediate customer impact at 18:40 UTC, our on-call responders reverted the problematic change that had been made to the event-processing service, thereby restoring event processing to its full capacity. The active incident resolved immediately, resulting in a full restoration of normal functionality for new incoming events and the Events API, as well as for the Web UI and REST API. However, there was a backlog of events in a dead letter queue which had yet to be retried. That backlog of events was successfully processed by 19:44 UTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBetween 18:10 and 19:44 UTC, event ingestion was impacted as follows: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\nApproximately 4% of Events API requests were returned with HTTP 5XX error responses.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n4.8% of notifications were delivered outside of SLA.  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Are Doing About It\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFollowing this incident, our teams conducted a thorough post-mortem investigation which identified several factors that contributed to this incident.

Those allocations were transferred to other functioning hosts, so indicators of degradation in our system did not appear until 22:25 UTC when a monitor for excessive failed allocations was triggered. As the configuration change continued to roll out, additional hosts began to repeatedly restart. Customer impact began at 22:15 UTC when enough hosts were restarting that there were insufficient healthy hosts to process all Events API requests. Alerts notified responders, and a major incident was triggered at 22:25 UTC after the first few 500 errors. The deployment was paused and failed events were immediately re-queued for processing. At 22:40 UTC, we observed recovery and an end to delayed customer events. The configuration change was rolled forward to a known good configuration and additional hosts were provisioned.

As a result of delays to event processing, customers also would have also experienced a delay in notifications. At 20:31 UTC, the cause of the incident was mitigated and systems began returning to normal. Incident/Alert actions were once again functional and we began making progress on the backlog of events.

This upgrade completed at approximately 19:30 UTC on August 2nd. At 20:18 UTC, we began to observe an increase in HTTP requests timeouts for the application which leverages this database. This resulted in internal teams being paged to investigate the issue. The investigation uncovered that there was a high amount of lock contention on a database table which is essential for the Incident/Alert lifecycle. This lock contention caused requests to the database which interact with this table to hang. This resulted in failed HTTP responses to users and halted our ability to process events. At 20:31 UTC, a limit within the database was hit which allowed it to abort the hung requests. Due to this event, database requests were once again able to complete successfully. All database metrics and the HTTP error rates began to return to normal levels. Users were once again able to perform actions against Incidents/Alerts and we began making progress on the backlog of events. By 20:49 UTC, all delayed events were processed and all systems returned to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat We Are Doing About This\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFollowing the incident, the team was able to identify that there were write queries against one particular table which did not complete between 20:18 and 20:31 UTC during the impacted time period.

The changes were around how integration specific transformation configurations would be separately packaged and deployed on the backend for them to be executed at the time of processing events against those integrations. The changes, as it turned out, introduced some incompatibility with few of our integrations. However, the incompatibility wouldn’t come into effect until changes were made to the integrations themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn the day of the incident, configuration changes were made to the Azure integration, which activated the latent issue on the service, resulting in failures when processing Azure events.

This elevated traffic stressed the services responsible for scheduling incident notifications and status updates past expected surge levels. 1.33% of incident notifications and 5.73% of status updates were delayed as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nShortly after the surge decreased, our system was able to catch up to its expected processing levels. All queued incident notifications and status updates were processed and sent. New incident notifications and status updates were sent on time as of June 21st at 07:08 UTC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nWhat Are We Doing About This\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nTo prevent internet-wide events from affecting the delivery of incident notifications and status updates in the future we are actively reviewing database resource utilization to ensure proper surge capacity. We are also implementing additional monitoring to detect burst events such as these in the future. Both of which will allow us to better protect our customers from future surge events. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
